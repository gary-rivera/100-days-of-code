Goals:

- Be better programmer than you were yesterday.
- Revamp personal website.
- Use DevEd's course for inspiration on React projects.

- Familiarize myself with the following technologies:

  - MongoDB
  - GraphQL
  - Elm
  - Typescript
  - Django

- Refamiliarize my understanding of the following technologies:
  - JS (vanilla + incorporating external libraries)
  - Python. So powerful and I've really let those skills slip
  - Node.js + Express
  - Flask

Day 0

Tomorrow I begin 100 consecutive days of coding. As excited as I may be I'm still very nervous about the challenge. I think my first task will be improving my personal website.

Day 1

Sheesh. This was tough to see my skills regressed so quickly. Set up for a simple react app and repo took me about 15 to 20 minutes and a lot reviewing how branches work. I've decided to treat this redesign as much as I can to what it would be like in an acutal coding work environement so habitually merging from master daily, notating significant changes during commits.

All in all, I'm happy I'm doing this.

Day 2

I have decided to juggle two things: my personal website overhaul from vanilla to modern react and learning how to use Elm. The React Podcast advises that before learning Typescript they'd recommend learning Elm first to help understand the nuances of static typed languages.

I'm happy to be taking the fast route for personal website and hope to have it deployed my maybe Tuesday at the latest.

Day 3

After 16 weeks of learning new technology after new technology, its really nice being able to take my time and put trivial things such as 'export default' vs 'module.exports' into perspective. Also decided to pick up Elm in the meantime to reintroduce myself into a static languages.

Day 4

Took a break from personal website and it's styling to continue on hangman-elm, which lead to crash course refreshed on Node/express as I needed to create a backend app that serves up a dynamic word when its endpoint is pinged. It's all hooked up, now just need to make some quick tests to make sure the routes work.

Day 5

having a blast getting my personal website to a point where I think it actually represents my current skillset. Eventually I'd like to have my portfolio dynamically pull my projects from the github api instead of statically entering them and already came across some awesome resources to do so.

React libraries is something I never got a chance to work with and seeing how ones such as styled-components and frame-motion can work together is enlightening.
