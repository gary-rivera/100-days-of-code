Goals:

- Be better programmer than you were yesterday.
- Revamp personal website.
- Use DevEd's course for inspiration on React projects.

- Familiarize myself with the following technologies:

  - MongoDB
  - GraphQL
  - Elm
  - Typescript
  - Django

- Refamiliarize my understanding of the following technologies:
  - JS (vanilla + incorporating external libraries)
  - Python. So powerful and I've really let those skills slip
  - Node.js + Express
  - Flask

Day 0

Tomorrow I begin 100 consecutive days of coding. As excited as I may be I'm still very nervous about the challenge. I think my first task will be improving my personal website.

Day 1

Sheesh. This was tough to see my skills regressed so quickly. Set up for a simple react app and repo took me about 15 to 20 minutes and a lot reviewing how branches work. I've decided to treat this redesign as much as I can to what it would be like in an acutal coding work environement so habitually merging from master daily, notating significant changes during commits.

All in all, I'm happy I'm doing this.

Day 2

I have decided to juggle two things: my personal website overhaul from vanilla to modern react and learning how to use Elm. The React Podcast advises that before learning Typescript they'd recommend learning Elm first to help understand the nuances of static typed languages.

I'm happy to be taking the fast route for personal website and hope to have it deployed my maybe Tuesday at the latest.

Day 3

After 16 weeks of learning new technology after new technology, its really nice being able to take my time and put trivial things such as 'export default' vs 'module.exports' into perspective. Also decided to pick up Elm in the meantime to reintroduce myself into a static languages.

Day 4

Took a break from personal website and it's styling to continue on hangman-elm, which lead to crash course refreshed on Node/express as I needed to create a backend app that serves up a dynamic word when its endpoint is pinged. It's all hooked up, now just need to make some quick tests to make sure the routes work.

Day 5

having a blast getting my personal website to a point where I think it actually represents my current skillset. Eventually I'd like to have my portfolio dynamically pull my projects from the github api instead of statically entering them and already came across some awesome resources to do so.

React libraries is something I never got a chance to work with and seeing how ones such as styled-components and frame-motion can work together is enlightening.

Day 6

Could barely manage to pull myself to code today. Frankly most of todays coding was following tutorials but I'd love to expand my abilities with using motion and styled components libraries. Coding is tough because day in and day out you have to come to terms with so many of your shortcomings and whenever you look around you everyone seems to get it so much quicker. It's times like these that I gotta remind myself most poeple don't share their struggles online and everyone gets stuck at some point.

Day 7

Website framework is completely fleshed out at this point but sheesh is this styling thing a pain. Still pretty dope to see how styled-components and motion library work together and overall excited to get this published

Day 8

More React on personal site. Deciding how the site navigation layout feels so foreign. Never considered how my code design will affect whether users have a positive or negative interaction with my work.
\_

Sat Jun 26 20:44:11 PDT 2021
Day 9

Worked out how to deploy a react app whilst hosting static files. Wayyy easier than I made it out to be but I eventually figured it was due to some external library I installed and forgot about, so that was fun. Not sure that I'll ever actually get faster at debugging but I'm too deep into it now. Gotta keep swimming.
\_

Sun Jun 27 19:04:40 PDT 2021
Day 10

Rather successful day. I've reworked the app to eventually be a single page website that utilizes hashrouter instead. Just felt the flow of the page navigation was better that way. Between that and rendering my portfolio I'm pretty close to fully deploying!
\_

Mon Jun 28 22:17:03 PDT 2021
Day 11

Styling is such a love/hate thing but i'm getting the hang of styled components' philosophy and it's really helping avoiding styles clashing between one another. Should be able to deploy either mid tomorrow or early wednesday.
\_

Day 12

Getting close, my list of bugs is starting to dwindle and a lot of that rust is wearing away! This project has solidified my love of React and has me geeked for deploying. I'm starting to create an almost uneccessary stress to myself to get this done but I've got to slow down and understand these changes need to take time. I guess its because I'm so concerned that all these applications I send out are for nothing. But I've got to relax. It's a marathon, not a race.

Wed Jun 30 12:00:00 PDT 2021
Day 13

Decided even though my page wasn't fully ready to deploy (yay styling) I'd just give it an 'under maintenance' look and get it out tomorrow while I get it finished. Messing with state and creating reusable components was tough but super dope!
\_

Thur Jul 1 12:00:00 PDT 2021
Day 14

Dependencies clashing with one another, surprise 'exact path' bug breaking resume link, and configuring DNS server + github pages but its done. My (partially complete) website page is deployed :)

Fri Jul 2 12:00:00 PDT 2021
Took a day off. Add to the end of the 100 days!

Sat Jul 3 22:55:33 PDT 2021
Day 15

Took some time away yesterday after the deploying fiasco but back to #100DaysOfCode for Day 15 today. I was starting to feel scatter brained with the minute changes I needed to make so I decided to try and replicate a real world work environemnt and set up issues + use brancehs for my sites repo. It's def helping with keeping a clear head on what I'm hoping to accomplich with my time.

Day 16
Day 16 is in the books. Dividing my approach into more chunk sized milestones is proving to be really helpful. What I thought would take me 6 to 8 hours today only eneded up being about 3. Anywho, got the about me section about 90% done and then off to the portfolio part :)
