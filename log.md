Goals:

- Be better programmer than you were yesterday.
- Revamp personal website.
- Use DevEd's course for inspiration on React projects.

- Familiarize myself with the following technologies:

  - MongoDB
  - GraphQL
  - Elm
  - Typescript
  - Django

- Refamiliarize my understanding of the following technologies:
  - JS (vanilla + incorporating external libraries)
  - Python. So powerful and I've really let those skills slip
  - Node.js + Express
  - Flask

Day 0

Tomorrow I begin 100 consecutive days of coding. As excited as I may be I'm still very nervous about the challenge. I think my first task will be improving my personal website.

Day 1

Sheesh. This was tough to see my skills regressed so quickly. Set up for a simple react app and repo took me about 15 to 20 minutes and a lot reviewing how branches work. I've decided to treat this redesign as much as I can to what it would be like in an acutal coding work environement so habitually merging from master daily, notating significant changes during commits.

All in all, I'm happy I'm doing this.

Day 2

I have decided to juggle two things: my personal website overhaul from vanilla to modern react and learning how to use Elm. I heard from \_\_\_\_ on the React Podcast that before learning Typescript he'd recommend learning Elm to help understand the nuances of static typed languages.

I'm happy to be taking the fast route for personal website and hope to have it deployed my maybe Tuesday at the latest.

Day 3

After 16 weeks of learning new technology after new technology, its really nice being able to take my time and put trivial things such as 'export default' vs 'module.exports' into perspective. Also decided to pick up Elm in the meantime to reintroduce myself into a static languages.
